<h1>Exception Handling in Java</h1>

Exceptions are nothing but runtime Errors which are executed while running a program and these are referred to as exceptions.
Before we get to understand about these exceptions we need to know about error’s, these are the actual program thing which causes the disturbance in the program not being executed properly and unwanted distruption.

The Errors are majorly classified into many types as we know some of the errors as if we are the person who knows at least one minimum programming language like even C.

It’s Generally basic hand for everyone to make mistakes, even simple ones.

So Exception handling helps you to minimise your waste of time on not looking merely more time on looking out and finding the errors so this is the concept that the computer scientists had taken into the picture.

There are two types of Errors:
The mistakes made by the programmer
The mistakes made by the user.

For
<ul>
  <li>
  Syntax Error → Compilers
</li>
<li>
  Logical Error → Debugger 
</li>
<li>
  Runtime Error → Exception Handling 
</li>
</ul>

The problem occurs at the user when he provides the bad input to the program and the unavailability of resources.

For this programmer has to develop his programs in such a way that he is used to show the user the error message and he can provide the correct information.
